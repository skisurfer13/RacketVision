## üåü Key Features

- **TrackNet for Tennis Ball Tracking**: Provides precise, real-time tracking of tennis ball movement during rallies.
- **YOLOv8 for Player Detection**: Accurately tracks player movement across the court, even under complex motion scenarios.
- **CNN for Court Feature Extraction**: Identifies key court features, ensuring accurate mapping of player and ball positions relative to the court boundaries.
- **CatBoost Regressor for Ball Bounce Prediction**: Predicts the bounce location of the tennis ball with high accuracy, supporting the Hawk-Eye decision system.
- **Mini-Map Visualization**: Real-time mini-map displaying the positions and movements of players and the ball, offering intuitive game dynamics visualization.
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Computes player speed, shot speed, shot depth, and provides average performance statistics for players.
- **Hawk-Eye System Integration**: Automatically detects and highlights out-of-bound shots using court boundary mapping.

## üîß Architecture Overview

### 1. **TrackNet for Ball Tracking**
   - **Deep Learning Model**: TrackNet leverages a VGG-16-based architecture to track high-speed tennis balls in standard broadcast videos using a heatmap-based approach for motion detection.
   - **Multi-Frame Input**: Processes consecutive frames for improved accuracy, particularly when the ball is blurry or occluded.

### 2. **YOLOv8 for Player Detection**
   - **Object Detection Algorithm**: YOLOv8 ensures fast and robust player detection, even under dynamic movements and occlusions, facilitating reliable player tracking.

### 3. **CNN for Court Feature Extraction**
   - **Feature Detection**: Extracts key court features, such as lines and net, allowing the system to accurately map player and ball positions.
   - **Homography Transformation**: Ensures precise mapping of predicted court points to reference court points, improving accuracy in occlusion scenarios.

### 4. **CatBoost Regressor for Ball Bounce Prediction**
   - **High-Accuracy Predictions**: Predicts the bounce of the tennis ball with minimal hyperparameter tuning, critical for real-time applications like the Hawk-Eye system.

## üñºÔ∏è Visual Components

### Mini-Map Visualization
The **Mini-Map** component provides a real-time visualization of both players' and the ball‚Äôs positions on a simplified court layout. It dynamically updates throughout the game, providing real-time insights on player positioning, ball movement, and court coverage.

### Hawk-Eye System
Whenever the ball lands outside the valid court region, the **Hawk-Eye OUT** box is displayed to highlight incorrect shots, aiding in decision-making.

### Real-Time Metrics Analysis
Key statistics like player speed, shot speed, and depth are displayed in the analysis box. Metrics include:
- **Player Speed**: Real-time player speed tracking.
- **Shot Speed**: Speed of each shot and average shot speed for both players.
- **Shot Depth**: Analysis of how deep the shots land in the opponent's court.
